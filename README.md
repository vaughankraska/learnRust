## Learning Rust Playground

Hi there! This repository serves as my personal playground for learning Rust. Expect to find experiments, unfinished projects, and a whole lot of trying (and sometimes failing!) as I navigate this exciting language. Feel free to ignore any messiness, it's all part of the learning process!

**Current Focus:**

* Getting comfortable with core syntax and data types.
* Understanding ownership and borrowing concepts.

**Resources:**

* https://www.rust-lang.org/learn
* The Rust Programming Language Book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
* Rustlings Online Tutorial: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/
* Rust by example: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/
